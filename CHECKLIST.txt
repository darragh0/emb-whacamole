Project Checklist - Final Tasks
================================

## Testing & Verification (CRITICAL - 40% of marks!)

### FR-3: Real-time Implementation (20%)
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Control task and agent/UART task run at DIFFERENT priorities
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Bi-directional queues exist between threads (identify which queues)
- [ ] **DOCUMENT**: List all FreeRTOS tasks with their priorities
- [ ] **DOCUMENT**: List all queues and what data flows through them

### Comms Protocol & Resilience (20%)
- [ ] Test: Game continues running when agent is disconnected (unplug USB)
- [ ] Test: Agent can disconnect and reconnect mid-game
- [ ] Test: Events buffer correctly during disconnect
- [ ] Verify device auto-reconnects when agent comes back
- [ ] **NEW**: Add CRC checksum to JSON messages for error detection
- [ ] **NEW**: Implement sequence numbers to detect missed/duplicate packets
- [ ] **NEW**: Add message acknowledgment for critical commands
- [ ] **NEW**: Test corrupted message handling (simulate bad data)

### Innovation (30%)
- [ ] Test all commands work: Pause, Start, Reset, Level (1-8)
- [ ] Prepare to explain why commands demonstrate innovation
- [ ] Highlight real-time cloud control in demo

## Code Quality (15%)

- [ ] Add comments explaining FreeRTOS task priorities
- [ ] Document queue mechanisms and thread communication
- [ ] Ensure code is modular and readable
- [ ] Remove any commented-out debug code
- [ ] Verify all team members understand ALL code sections

## Demo Preparation (15%)

- [ ] Write 3-5-minute demo script:
  * Show device working (game play)
  * Do powerpoint presentation
  * Show dashboard updates in real-time
  * Demonstrate commands from cloud
  * Explain FreeRTOS architecture
  * Highlight innovation features

- [ ] Practice explaining:
  * Thread priorities and why they're set that way
  * Queue mechanisms for inter-thread communication
  * Protocol design between agent and device
  * How disconnects/reconnects are handled

- [ ] Be ready to answer questions about ANY code section

## Final Checks

- [ ] Clean working directory (no build artifacts in git)
- [ ] Update README with setup instructions
- [ ] Test end-to-end one final time before demo
- [ ] Ensure all three team members can explain the system

## Key Points to Emphasize in Demo/Interview

1. **Innovation**: Real-time cloud commands (P/S/R/1-8) show sophisticated control
2. **Real-time**: FreeRTOS with proper priorities and queuing
3. **Resilience**: Works without agent, handles disconnects gracefully
4. **Protocol**: Custom JSON-over-UART protocol
5. **Code Quality**: Well-structured, commented, team-understood

JJ's Task Checklist - Innovation & Commands
===========================================

## Primary Goal: Boost Innovation Score (30% of marks!)

### ✅ COMPLETED:
- [x] Level jump command (L1-L8) - cloud to board real-time control
  - Board: UART handler processes '1'-'8' commands
  - Cloud: send_level() function and POST endpoint
  - Dashboard: (Tom should add UI for this)
- [x] Reset Command (R)
  - [x] Add 'R' handling in pause.c UART_Handler
  - [x] Send CMD_RESET to game task via cmd_queue
  - [x] Game task resets to level 1, restores 5 lives
  - [x] Cloud: send_reset() function in mqtt.py
  - [x] Cloud: POST /command/{device_id}/reset endpoint
- [x] Start Command (S)
  - [x] Add 'S' handling in pause.c UART_Handler
  - [x] Send CMD_START to game task
  - [x] Game starts if idle
  - [x] Cloud: send_start() function
  - [x] Cloud: POST /command/{device_id}/start endpoint

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS / TODO:

1. Deploy to Alderaan Server
   - Wait for Mark to install python3.13-venv
   - Deploy cloud backend to alderaan.software-engineering.ie:8000
   - Test end-to-end with remote cloud

2. Test Full Stack
   - Board → Agent → MQTT → Cloud → Dashboard
   - Test all commands work: Pause, Level jump, Reset, Start
   - Test disconnect/reconnect resilience
   - Verify event buffering during disconnects

3. Prepare Demo Script
   - Write 10-minute demo walkthrough
   - Practice explaining FreeRTOS patterns
   - Be ready to explain ANY part of code
   - Highlight innovation features

### 📊 Team Division:
- **JJ (you)**: Commands & board-cloud communication (innovation!)
- **Tom**: Dashboard frontend (stats, charts, polish UI)
- **Darragh**: Leaderboard feature idea (if time permits)

### 🎯 Focus Areas for Maximum Marks:
- Innovation (30%) - Commands show sophisticated real-time control
- Real-time Implementation (20%) - Already strong with FreeRTOS
- Comms Protocol & Resilience (20%) - MQTT, reconnection, buffering
- Code Quality (15%) - Comments added ✓
- Demo (15%) - Practice and polish

### 💡 Quick Wins Remaining:
1. Test everything works (1 hour)
2. Deploy to cloud server (30 min once python3-venv is ready)
3. Practice demo (1 hour)

TOTAL TIME REMAINING: ~4-5 hours to maximizing marks!
